# 1.1.7: HTTP Versions

- **HTTP/1.0:** The original. Very slow, as it required a new TCP connection for every single resource.
- **HTTP/1.1:** The long-time workhorse. Introduced persistent connections (Keep-Alive) but suffered from Head-of-Line (HOL) blocking.
- **HTTP/2:** Solved HOL blocking with **multiplexing**, allowing multiple requests/responses to be interleaved over a single TCP connection. Also added a binary format and header compression. Made loading many small files efficient.
- **HTTP/3:** Solves the final HOL blocking problem at the TCP layer by using **QUIC**, a new protocol built on UDP. A lost packet only blocks its own stream, not the whole connection.
