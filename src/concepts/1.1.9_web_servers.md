# 1.1.9: Web Servers

- **Role:** A web server is the software that listens for HTTP requests and sends back responses (e.g., Nginx, Apache, IIS).
- **Nginx vs. Apache:** Nginx uses a modern, event-driven architecture that is lightweight and excels at high concurrency. Apache's traditional model uses a thread-per-connection, which is powerful but memory-heavy.
- **Reverse Proxy:** In modern apps, a web server like Nginx often acts as a reverse proxy. It sits in front of the application server (e.g., Node.js), handling SSL, serving static files, security, and load balancing.
