# 1.1.11: Basic Web Security Concepts

- **TLS & Certificates:** TLS is the encryption layer for HTTPS. Trust is established via a TLS Certificate, a digital passport for a domain issued by a trusted Certificate Authority (CA). The browser verifies this certificate to authenticate the server.
- **Same-Origin Policy (SOP):** A critical browser security rule. It prevents a script from one origin (Protocol + Host + Port) from accessing data on a page from a different origin. This is a firewall against cross-site data theft.
