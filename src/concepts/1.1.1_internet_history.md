# 1.1.1: Internet History and Evolution

- **Core Purpose:** The internet's ancestor, ARPANET, was a military project designed for resilience. Its decentralized, packet-switched design was meant to survive a network failure, a principle that still makes the internet robust today.
- **Internet vs. Web:** The "Internet" is the physical infrastructure of networks and routers. The "World Wide Web" is a service that runs on the internet, created by Tim Berners-Lee. He invented the three core components: HTML (for content structure), URLs (for addresses), and HTTP (for transport).
- **Evolution of Interactivity:** The web evolved from "Web 1.0" (static, read-only pages) to "Web 2.0" (the interactive, read-write web) thanks to technologies like AJAX, which allowed parts of a page to update without a full reload. Modern web apps (SPAs) built with frameworks like React are the culmination of this trend.
