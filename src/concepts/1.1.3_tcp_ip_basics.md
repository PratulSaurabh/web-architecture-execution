# 1.1.3: TCP/IP Basics

- **IP (Internet Protocol):** Handles addressing. Its only job is to get packets to the right IP address. It offers no guarantees of delivery.
- **Ports:** A port is a number that directs a packet to a specific application on a computer. An IP address gets the packet to the right building; a port gets it to the right apartment.
- **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol):** The "reliable" protocol. It establishes a connection with a 3-way handshake, guarantees that all packets are delivered in the correct order, and re-transmits any lost packets. This is used for web browsing, email, and anything requiring 100% accuracy.
- **UDP (User Datagram Protocol):** The "fast" protocol. It sends data without any handshake or delivery guarantees. It's ideal for time-sensitive applications like video streaming or online gaming, where speed is more important than perfect reliability.
