# 1.1.8: Statelessness & Sessions

- **HTTP is Stateless:** The server forgets everything about a client after each request.
- **Sessions Create State:** To "remember" a user, we create a session.
- **Server-Side Sessions:** The classic method. The server stores user data in a database, keyed by a random Session ID. It gives only the ID to the client in a cookie. This is secure and easy to revoke.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens):** A modern, stateless approach. The server packs user data into a cryptographically signed token and gives the whole thing to the client. The server validates the token with math, not a database lookup. This is fast and scalable but harder to revoke.
