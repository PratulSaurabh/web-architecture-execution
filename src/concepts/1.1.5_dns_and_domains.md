# 1.1.5: DNS & Domains

- **DNS (Domain Name System):** The internet's phonebook. It translates human-friendly domain names (like `google.com`) into computer-friendly IP addresses.
- **Resolution Process:** DNS resolution is a hierarchical chase. A client asks a Resolver, which asks the Root servers, then the TLD servers (`.com`), and finally the domain's Authoritative Name Server to get the final IP address.
- **Caching (TTL):** DNS is heavily cached at every level to be fast and scalable. The Time To Live (TTL) value on a DNS record dictates how long it can be cached.
- **Record Types:** Different records serve different purposes. `A` records map to an IPv4 address, `MX` records handle mail, and `CNAME` records create aliases.
