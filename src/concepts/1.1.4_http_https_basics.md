# 1.1.4: HTTP & HTTPS Basics

- **HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol):** The application-layer language of the web. It's a stateless, text-based, request-response protocol between a client (browser) and a server.
- **Request Structure:** An HTTP request contains a request line (e.g., `GET /page HTTP/1.1`), headers (metadata), and an optional body (data).
- **Response Structure:** An HTTP response contains a status line (e.g., `HTTP/1.1 200 OK`), headers, and an optional body (the content).
- **HTTPS:** This is not a separate protocol. It is simply HTTP running over an encrypted SSL/TLS connection. It provides confidentiality, integrity, and authentication.
