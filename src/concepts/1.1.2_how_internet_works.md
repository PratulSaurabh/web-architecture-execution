# 1.1.2: How the Internet Works

- **Packets:** Data is not sent as one big file. It's broken into small, numbered pieces called packets. Each packet has a header with the source and destination IP addresses.
- **IP Addresses:** An IP address is a unique numerical label for a device on the internet, acting like a postal address.
- **Routing:** Routers are the post offices of the internet. They look at a packet's destination IP and forward it to the next best "hop" on its journey. No single router knows the full path. This process is what makes the network decentralized and resilient.
- **ISPs:** Your Internet Service Provider (ISP) is the on-ramp from your private local network (like your home Wi-Fi) to the public internet backbone.
